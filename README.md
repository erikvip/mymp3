# mymp3
Music discovery tool

**This project is an early alpha & under active development, it is not ready for use**

## Purpose
At this time, the main purpose of this project is a learning exercise for myself.  It is a place for me to learn AngularJS, NodeJS and NoSQL database design.  I hope it will eventually be a useful tool for finding new music, but it may never get past the playground stage. 

## Goals
- Convert Youtube videos to MP3's with proper id3 tags
- Assemble entire albums by using MusicBrainz to locate tracks
- Find similar artists using LastFM's Similar Artists feature
- Recommend new music using Youtube and LastFM recommendations
- Be a standalone, multi platform application that anyone can use, without any external dependencies

### Secondary Goals
- Scan existing library and build recommendations & exclusions based on existing collection
- Pandora / JukeBox style functionality
- MPD Support
